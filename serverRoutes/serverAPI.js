//require controller

//all functions used in this file will be from controller

//router.get("/music") makes it so the url to access the api is /api/music thanks to index.js

//router.route("/")
//.get(controller.findAll)
//.post(controller.createSomething)... once the user hits the final slash (api/music/) the API call will get something from the DB and post it using the same route and controller functions
//Front end decides which method(.get, .post, .put, etc) to call along the same route
//REST API!
